Development Workflow Documentation
Agentic AI System for Micro-SaaS Validation
1. Introduction
This document outlines the comprehensive development workflow for building the Agentic AI system. It follows industry standard Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) practices and includes specific workflows for AI/ML components.
2. Planning Phase
The planning phase establishes the foundation for development:
* Requirements gathering and analysis
* System architecture design
* Technology stack selection
* Sprint planning and task breakdown
* Resource allocation and timeline estimation
3. Development Environment Setup
Essential setup requirements include:
* Version control system (Git)
* Development IDE configuration
* Python virtual environment setup
* Required libraries and dependencies installation
* API keys and authentication setup
* Database configuration
4. Development Workflow
4.1 Sprint Structure
Development follows a two-week sprint cycle:
* Sprint Planning (Day 1)
* Daily Stand-ups
* Development and Testing
* Sprint Review (Day 14)
* Sprint Retrospective
4.2 Code Management
Branch Strategy:
* main - Production branch
* develop - Development branch
* feature/* - Feature branches
* bugfix/* - Bug fix branches
* release/* - Release branches
5. Testing Workflow
* Unit Testing - Individual components
* Integration Testing - Component interactions
* System Testing - End-to-end functionality
* Performance Testing - System optimization
* User Acceptance Testing - Final validation
6. Deployment Pipeline
Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipeline:
* Code commit and push
* Automated testing
* Code quality checks
* Build process
* Staging deployment
* Production deployment
7. Monitoring and Maintenance
* System health monitoring
* Performance metrics tracking
* Error logging and analysis
* Regular security updates
* Database maintenance
* Model performance monitoring
8. Documentation
Documentation requirements:
* Code documentation and comments
* API documentation
* System architecture documentation
* User guides
* Maintenance documentation
9. Quality Assurance
* Code review process
* Testing protocols
* Performance benchmarking
* Security assessment
* Compliance verification
